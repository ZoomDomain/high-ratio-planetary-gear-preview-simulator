# high-ratio-planetary-gear-preview-simulator

its a PC program where you can put different planetary gears and it will animate them at accurate rotation ratios. 

it was just for messing and it's for ring sizes up to about 75 teeth, then the graphics become messed up.

see thingiverse zoon1234micron for a mesh generator for 3d printing high ratio gears
